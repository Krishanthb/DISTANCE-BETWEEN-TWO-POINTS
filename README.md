# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: Define a function to calculate distance
### Step 2: Get input from the user
### Step 3: Call the function to calculate distance
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: handle potential errors during the calculation
### Step 5: Display the result

### PROGRAM:
```#Program to find the distance between two points.

import math
l2=[10,6]
l1=[4,2]
distance=math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```
